Manu,

Here is the first cut.

These are the things I need to complete this

1. Texts in the result page.
2. What all fields are there in the login page
3. What has to be done with the user entered fields
	To be saved somewhere in db or something like that
	Is there any validation needed for the login page or let the user move ahead with out forcing
4. What has to be shared in using social icons
	If the results, whoms accont
5. Score calculation 
	Is that with percentage or shows the correct answers user made.
6. Need icons to be showed in the mobile and tablet
	Right now i used a dummy one which will apprer in device
	Now icons we need should be of 96,72,48,36 square pixels


Above all please do provide change iteration to the max of 2 times.
If its goes more than that, It would make me unconfortable :)
So I would kidly suggest you to give me a collaborated change request rather that one by one.

Thanks,
Anand
